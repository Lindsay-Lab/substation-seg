# Substation segmentation
The aim of this project is to build a computer vision model for segmenting substations in Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. This directory contains code to train and evaluate multiple kinds of segmentation models. We experiment with different kinds of architectures, losses and training strategies. 

## The directory structure:
- dataset
  - image_stack
  - mask
- dataloader.py
- models.py
- utils.py
- Sentinel.py
- other training scripts
